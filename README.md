# SuperGoalsAPI

About the project:
This repo is a personal project, and a mix of:
- Thought experiment into whether I could make a TODO/goal tracking app that works better for me than others I've tried (MS Todo, Wunderlist before they bought it)
- A real project I can use to try out new technologies I don't have the opportunity to try in the workplace for one reason or another

Prereqs:
- .NET 6 SDK

Other fun architecture things in progress:
- Swashbuckle for OpenAPI documentation (TODO)
- Npgsql to use PostgreSQL (TODO)
- MSTest for unit testing (TODO)
